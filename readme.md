Protip:

You can update your `/etc/hosts` file to add a name to your service:

```
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1  localhost
255.255.255.255  broadcasthost
::1             localhost


192.168.10.10  starter.site.dev
```

Then you can point your browser to http://starter.site.dev
